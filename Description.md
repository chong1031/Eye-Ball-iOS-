“Goggle Ball” App
A simple, fun play app for all ages.
Play
When a user starts a game, the game launches with the 3D image of an animated character or
clown, with their eyes large and presented as targets with their eyeballs in the middle. The eyes look
like below with the eyeball in the middle.
The nose of the character is the “START” button. When the user presses start the characters eyeballs
fly around the eyes randomly. The nose changes to the “STOP” button and when the user presses
“STOP” the eyeballs stop in their eyes.
The user gets points for where the eyeballs stop:
Outside ring – 10 points
Next ring in – 20 points
Next ring in – 30 points
Next ring in – 40 points
Middle ring – 50 points
So, if the left eyeball stops in the outer ring and the right eyeball stops in the middle ring the game
says “60 POINTS”
When a user plays the game they get 5 throws of the eyeballs. At the end of the five throws the
game’s total points are presented to the user. (So the maximum points a game can achieve is 500
POINTS). For example, the end of the game may display:
TOTAL SCORE: 230 POINTS
THIS IS THE 34TH HIGHEST SCORE
Monetisation
The app will be free to use, initial monetisation will come from the purchase of SLOW BALLS.
The in-game screen we will have a button where the user can use a "SLOW BALL". If they use this
before or during a game the speed of the eyeballs will slow down making it easier for the use to stop
them when he thinks he'll get more points. The purchase of SLOW BALLS will be:
1 x SLOW BALL £0.99
3 x SLOW BALLS £2.49
5 x SLOW BALLS £3.99
10 x SLOW BALLS £6.99
Future monetisation of Goggle Ball will be through advertising, and the user option of an upgrade to
an advert-free version.
